# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Examples of positive behavior include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy and support toward other members

### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information (such as physical or electronic addresses) without explicit permission
- Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.  
Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, or other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor engaging in unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.  
Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **{{ your-contact-email }}**.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.  
The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who fail to follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project’s leadership.
